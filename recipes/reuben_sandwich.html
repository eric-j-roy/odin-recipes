        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A Reuben sandwich is one of my family's fix-it-quick favorites. 
            They are really delicious and easy to make. I like to serve them 
            with big bowls of steaming vegetable soup and dill pickles on the side.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
            <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>8 slices deli sliced corned beef</li>
            <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing. 
                On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 
                1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining 
                bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.</li>
            <li>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the 
                top of each sandwich with remaining butter. Grill until both sides are 
                golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
